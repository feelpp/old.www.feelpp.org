:page-teaser: "Boundary conditions involving pressure for the Stokes problem and applications to hemodynamics"
:page-liquid:



Our recent work on boundary conditions involving pressure for the Stokes problem and their applications in computational hemodynamics is now published in CMAME and available on line: +
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2017.04.024


== Highlights:

* A novel Lagrange multipliers-based formulation of the Stokes system involving pressure boundary condition on a part of the boundary is proposed.

* Discretization in a finite element framework and complete analysis, from the continuous to the discrete level, in two and three dimensions are provided.

* Optimal convergence rates are obtained for standard inf–sup stable finite element spaces, such as Taylor–Hood elements.

* Different algebraic solution strategies are proposed, including block factorization based preconditioners.

* Verification of the convergence properties and three-dimensional simulations of blood flow in the cerebral venous network are displayed.
