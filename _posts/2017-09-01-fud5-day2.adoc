The first day is already over with an overview of {feelpp} changes
over the past few months, the infrastructure supporting {feelpp} and a
discussion on Best Practices.

On Day 2, we start talks about research and collaboration projects.

We start with our oldest partner the LNCMI with The _High Field Magnet_ project aka HiFiMagnet.
Christophe Trophime (LNCMI) will present some recent results of our collaboration including first validations with experiments.
He will also talk about the expectations about the EU E-INFRA H2020 link:http://mso4sc.eu[MSO4SC] project.

Next we will have a talk from a CSMI Master Student Artemiy Dimov who will present his work on the collaboration project with the entreprise link:http://www.socomec.fr[Socomec].
We are interested in simulating the heat transfer within an industrial interruptor. It includes heat transfer, electric potential and fluid mechanics.

We then pursue with an opverview of the EU E-INFRA H2020 MSO4SC project and a presentation by Victor Sande Veiga from CESGA (Spain) regarding the cloud infrastructure of MSO4SC.

In the afternoon we start with a talk on our collaboration with Plastic Omnium Automotive.

Finally we have a tutorial on Salome and mesh generation by Christophe Trophime and Guillaume Doll√©.
