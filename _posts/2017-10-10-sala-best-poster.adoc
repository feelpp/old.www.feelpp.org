His thesis aims at achieving non-invasive access to ocular biomarkers, as surrogates of cerebral status, by developing mathematical models parametrized with patient-specific data to describe the fluid-dynamics and metabolic connections between the eye and the brain. 
The complexity of this Eye2Brain system calls for a multiscale modeling approach, and the high computational cost and complex numerical analysis required are provided by Feel++.

The results described in this poster are also very significant from a clinical viewpoint, being able to reproduce biomechanics and hemodynamics in various tissues of the eye.



== Collaborators and Sponsors

The poster has been realized with a collaboration with Politecnico di Milano.

This work has been partially supported by the Ministère de l'Enseignement supérieur et de la Recherche (France), NSF DMS-1224195, 
a grant from Research to Prevent Blindness (RPB, NY, USA), the Chair Gutenberg funds of the Cercle Gutenberg (France), the Center for Modeling and Simulation
in Strasbourg(Cemosis) and the Labex IRMIA (University of Strasbourg, France). 
This project has finally received funding thanks to MSO4SC from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 731063.
