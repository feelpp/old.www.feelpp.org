We will have an oral presentation and a poster at the VII Annual Meeting of the italian chapter 
of the European Society of Biomechanics which will take place in Rome.

This conference is held every year and it is organized by The Italian Chapter of the European Society of Biomechanics.
The thematic symposium on ocular biomechanics aims to bring together ophthalmologists and researchers working on the 
biomechanics of the eye, in order to share experiences, ideas, methods and results.

The general meeting will cover experimental and computational techniques for the study of the pathophysiological behaviour of biomechanical systems. 
A broad spectrum of scales will be covered, ranging from the cellular, through the tissue, up to organ scale. 
Medical devices and their interaction with living tissues will be also addressed. 
Accordingly, a snapshot of actual trends of biomechanical research will be provided.

Accepted extended abstracts submitted to the Thematic Symposium on Ocular Biomechanics will be collected in a special issue of the 
Journal for Modeling in Ophthalmology.


== Our contribution

Our group has proposed two extended abstract:

* [.underline]#L. Sala# , C. Prud’homme , M. Szopos , G. Guidoboni, __“Towards a full model for ocular biomechanics, fluid dynamics and hemodynamics”__; it has been accepted 
as an oral presentation. 
This contribution presents an ongoing work to implement a patient-specific mathematical virtual simulator for the eye. 
The aim is to create a multiscale and multiphysics model for the description of ocular biomechanics, fluid dynamics and hemodynamics. 
This instrument may serve to illustrate and estimate some clinically relevant parameters and predict their spatial and temporal evolution adopting forward-looking
numerical techniques.

* [.underline]#F. Stefanoni#, A. Harris, M. Szopos, C. Prud’homme, R. Sacco, D. Messenio, M.L. Costantino, G. Guidoboni, 
__“Clinical assessment of intraocular pressure: a whole eye dynamic model”__; it has been accepted as a poster.
The aim of this work is to provide a quantitative description of how geometrical and material properties of ocular tissues and fluids 
influence intraocular pressure (IOP).

The poster has been realized with a collaboration with Politecnico di Milano.

This work has been partially supported by the Ministère de l'Enseignement supérieur et de la Recherche (France), NSF DMS-1224195, 
a grant from Research to Prevent Blindness (RPB, NY, USA), the Chair Gutenberg funds of the Cercle Gutenberg (France), the Center for Modeling and Simulation
in Strasbourg(Cemosis) and the Labex IRMIA (University of Strasbourg, France). 
This project has finally received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 731063.
