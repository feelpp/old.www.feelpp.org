Post-doctoral researcher at the University of Strasbourg since July 2017.

== RESEARCH INTERESTS

I work on the mathematical modelling of biological flows, such as the rheology of flowing red blood cells and the adhesion and arrest of tumor cells in complex geometries. I also develop numerical tools to tackle the high-performance numerical simulations requested in this kind of problems.

As such, I am involved in the Vivabrain ANR and the Hemotum++ projects. These projects provide great frameworks to develop new numerical approaches designed for the complexity of biofluids, and validate these methods with various data from both _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ experiments lead by biologists I closely collaborate with.
