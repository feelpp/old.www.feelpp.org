== About me

I graduated with a MSc in Mathematical Engineering with the Major in Computational Models in Electronics and Biomathematics at Politecnico di Milano 
in Italy in 2016. 

Then I moved to France, in particular to the Université de Strasbourg , and after a period of six months working on the project Eye2Brain I obtained a 
scholarship for a position as PhD student in Applied Mathematics at the Université de Strasbourg.
